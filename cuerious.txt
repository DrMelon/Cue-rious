Cue-Rious Mechanic Ideas

Isometric world. 
Angle the cue for english/draw/follow/stop/lift/spin/curve.
Hotseat, so MP would just send angle/shot strength data. Do worms-style delayed turn info.
Players can compete to pot all balls on map, regardless of colour/stripe, finishing with 8
Players can compete to pot solids/stripes after a break in an arena-style map.
Players can compete to pot as many as possible in turn limit with trickshots.

Pockets on the map can either accept an infinite number of balls or have a limit. When the limit is reached, they just close over and become like normal terrain.

Can have wormhole pockets, where things fall in one way and come out another. Pipes, etc. Like marble madness/micro machines.

Scratching results in a missed turn, balls reset.

English selectable via common strike points? Maybe with QTE for accuracy. Definitely QTE slider for strength.

Closed pockets can also act as switches to open/close doors/bridges/tubes.
Chain reactions important. Peggle/Bust a move feel.

Hazards like spikes, oil, etc

Powerups: 

* Aimline extend, to see where curve shots can go etc.
* Bounciness up
* Bounciness down
* Accelerate ball
* Decelerate ball
* Jump/Float
* Sudden stop
* Reverse direction
* World grid/darkening to highlight distances
* Create pocket at bounce location
